EDIT: This is an abandond reminder for myself of my first attempt at a DApp

My end goal with this project is to have a decentralized application to facilitate the registration (proof of ownership), distribution, monetization, and curration of Intellectual Property (IP).

IP Registration: Ethereum
Distribution: IPFS
Monetization: Bitcoin
Curation: Steem

At the moment I am focusing primarily on the IP Registration using Ethereum Solidity smart contracts and will be developing the others as time goes on.

Cuurently in a pre-alpha/proof-of-concept stage of development, this is a meteor application.

Required meteor packages are:

Ethereumâ€™s Web3: meteor add ethereum:web3
Bitcore: sudo meteor npm install --save bitcore-lib
IPFS: sudo meteor npm install --save ipfs-api
